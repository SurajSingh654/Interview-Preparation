Approach1 --> Brute-Force: Multiply 4 by itself until you get number>=Given Value

Approach2 --> Convert Number in Base 4. Bit-Manipulation, as we know any powerOfFour value has only one set-Bit{in base 4}

Approach3 --> As Given Constraint is 2^31 so check last value which is less than 2^31 and also a power of four . Divide Given number by itself to check powerOfFour or not


class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfFour(int n) {
        if(n==0 || n==2){
            return false;
        }
        if(n==-Math.pow(2,31)){
            return false;
        }
        int num = Math.abs(n);
        return ((n & (n-1))==0) && ((Math.log(n)/Math.log(2))%2)==0;
    }
