Question: --> Given a 2D integer array matrix, return the transpose of matrix.

The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, switching the matrix's row and column indices.



Solution: 
Transpose of a matrix A is B such that
A(i,j) = B(j,i)

if A a have n row and m columns then B will have m rows and n columns.

public int[][] transpose(int[][] matrix) {
        int row = matrix.length;
        int col = matrix[0].length;
        
        int[][] res = new int[col][row];
        for(int i = 0;i<row;i++) {
            for(int j = 0;j<col;j++) {
                res[j][i] = matrix[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
T(n) = O(mn)
S(n) =O(mn)
