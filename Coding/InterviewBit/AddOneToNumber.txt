Question --> Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits, add 1 to the number ( increment the number represented by the digits ).

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

NOTE: Certain things are intentionally left unclear in this question which you should practice asking the interviewer. For example: 
for this problem, following are some good questions to ask :

Q : Can the input have 0's before the most significant digit. Or in other words, is 0 1 2 3 a valid input?
A : For the purpose of this question, YES
Q : Can the output have 0's before the most significant digit? Or in other words, is 0 1 2 4 a valid output?
A : For the purpose of this question, NO. Even if the input has zeroes before the most significant digit.



Approach --> If All Array elements are 9 then make them zero and add element 1 at index 0, else add 1 to all elements starting from last upto first element which is not equal to 9 ...

Solution!

public class Solution {
    public ArrayList<Integer> plusOne(ArrayList<Integer> A) {
        int i;
        for(i=A.size()-1;i>=0;i--){
           if(A.get(i)==9){
               A.set(i,0);
           }else{
              A.set(i,A.get(i)+1); 
              break;
           }
        }
        if(i==-1){
            A.add(0,1);
        }
        while(A.size()>0){
            if(A.get(0)==0){
                A.remove(0);
            }else{
                break;
            }
        }
        return A;
    }
}
