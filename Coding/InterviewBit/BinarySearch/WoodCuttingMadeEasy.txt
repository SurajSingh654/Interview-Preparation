Question: --> There is given an integer array A of size N denoting the heights of N trees.

Lumberjack Ojas needs to chop down B metres of wood. It is an easy job for him since he has a nifty new woodcutting machine that can take down forests like wildfire. However, Ojas is only allowed to cut a single row of trees.

Ojas's machine works as follows: Ojas sets a height parameter H (in metres), and the machine raises a giant sawblade to that height and cuts off all tree parts higher than H (of course, trees not higher than H meters remain intact). Ojas then takes the parts that were cut off. For example, if the tree row contains trees with heights of 20, 15, 10, and 17 metres, and Ojas raises his sawblade to 15 metres, the remaining tree heights after cutting will be 15, 15, 10, and 15 metres, respectively, while Ojas will take 5 metres off the first tree and 2 metres off the fourth tree (7 metres of wood in total).

Ojas is ecologically minded, so he doesn't want to cut off more wood than necessary. That's why he wants to set his sawblade as high as possible. Help Ojas find the maximum integer height of the sawblade that still allows him to cut off at least B metres of wood.

NOTE:

The sum of all heights will exceed B, thus Ojas will always be able to obtain the required amount of wood.

Approach: --> The Problem is based on Binary Search

So let’s start with thinking of monotonicity.

If you set a height parameter to something let’s say x and you are able to remove atleast B metres amount of wood then for every parameter less than x you can remove atleast B metres of wood.

This means you need to find the last x such that for every height parameter greater than x you cannot remove atleast B metres of wood.

So we just to binary search for this x.

Time Complexity: O(NlogN)
Space Complexity: O(1)



Solution:
public class Solution {
    public long totalHeight(int m,ArrayList<Integer> A ){
        long sum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<A.size();i++){
            if(A.get(i)>m)
            sum+=A.get(i)-m;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    public int solve(ArrayList<Integer> A, int B) {
        int lowestHeight = 0;
        int highestHeight = 0;
        int requiredHeight = 0;
           for(int i=0;i<A.size();i++){
            highestHeight=Math.max(highestHeight,A.get(i));
        }
        while(lowestHeight<=highestHeight){
            int midHeight = lowestHeight + ((highestHeight - lowestHeight)>>1) ;
            if(totalHeight(midHeight,A)>=(long)B){
               requiredHeight = Math.max(requiredHeight,midHeight);
               lowestHeight = midHeight + 1;
            }else{
                highestHeight = midHeight -1;
            }
        }
        return requiredHeight;
    }
}
